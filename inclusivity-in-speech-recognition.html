                            <h2>Towards more inclusive, accessible speech-recognition</h2>
                            <p class="excert">
                                After one too many unsuccessful attempts to get Siri to understand her, my mother bestowed the nickname, “la bruja,” to the voice assistant inside her iPhone.
                                 The literal translation is “witch,” but my mother’s frustrated context denotes a meaning closer to another word in English that also ends in -itch.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As I was raised by a non-native English speaker, I have been aware of the difficulties that follow non-native speakers for as long as I can remember.
                                In elementary school, I remember my mom getting into heated arguments with customer service representatives that could not understand her Spanish accent over 
                                the phone. As soon as I was old enough, around 10 years old, my mom would pass the phone to me so that I could talk to the phone reps who couldn’t understand her.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When voice recognition technology started being more popularly adopted around 2010 (Siri was first introduced in iPhones in 2011), my mother and others like her were met
                                with yet another medium to be misunderstood. My mom never asks Siri to give her the day’s weather forecast or to call my brother for her, since she’s grown used
                                to not being understood by voice assistants. While this might seem like a trivial inconvenience, voice assistants’ inaccurate performance with non-white American
                                English speakers actually points to a much larger problem in how this technology is developed: implicit biases in artificial intelligence (AI).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Despite the immense strides made in this industry since voice tech was popularized, these improvements come with a disparity in performance between white Americans 
                                and other speakers. Google’s speech-recognition technology boasts an error rate of less than 5% for transcribing, which is about a 15% improvement since 2017. 
                                However this stellar performance is typically only seen with white, American male speakers. This ideal candidate for speech-recognition also happens to be what 
                                the majority of voice tech developers look like, and they sound like the majority of the training sets used to create intelligent language technology as well.
                            </p>

                                A study conducted by researchers at Stanford University showed that five state-of-the-art atuomated speech-recognition systems were biased against African American speakers.

                            <div class="row">

                                        Research in this space has shown that even the largest players in speech-recognition have created biased systems. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/14/7684" target="_blank"> One Stanford study</a>
                                        examined automatic speech-recognition (ASR) systems developed by Amazon, Google, Apple, IBM, and Microsoft, and measured each’s performance in 
                                        structured interviews with white and black speakers. All 5 systems exhibited racial disparities, averaging a word error rate (WER) of .35 for 
                                        black speakers, and .19 for white speakers.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        These results have implications much greater than non-White populations simply being unable to use ASR systems to, say, send a transcribed text. Many 
                                        industries are increasingly adopting natural language processing (NLP) to automate the processing of types of audio. For example, speech recognition 
                                        software is used by employers to evaluate candidate interview videos or by criminal justice agencies to transcribe courtroom proceedings. If marginalized 
                                        people are being evaluated by ASR systems, then they face a higher chance of being misunderstood and receiving unfair treatment in situations like these. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    This issue mirrors the accent and language bias that exists between humans in spoken speech. 
                                    <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/speech-recognition-tech-is-yet-another-example-of-bias/#" target="_blank">Research </a> shows that 
                                    accented speech can affect whether jurors find someone guilty and influence patient perceptions of their doctor’s competency. Recognizing these biases 
                                    from a socio-cultural perspective is an important first step in dealing with the biases in AI. Other necessary procedures to ensure that ASR systems are 
                                    more inclusive include establishing diversity in the teams working on them and using training data that represents a variety of different accents and dialects, 
                                    like African American Vernacular English (AAVE) or deaf accents.

                                            who is committed to helping companies and policymakers address bias in AI, are working diligently to improve inclusivity in speech-recognition 
                                            technology.  The Common Voice dataset is a new project that is the largest public domain transcribed dataset in the world. It contains over 4,000 
                                            recorded hours of audio in 35 languages and is tagged with metadata on age, gender and accents that is useful in training speech regimes. 
    
                                        </p>
                                        <h3> Call to action</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            I believe that setting a baseline for diversity in training sets used by companies whose ASR technology is involved with making sensitive decisions, could be 
                                            one way to help remedy this issue on a broader scale. Big Tech companies should set the standard and make pledges that commit their datasets to being more diverse and 
                                            representative of non-white users. More money in research and development should be invested by these companies to acquire more data from minority 
                                            speakers and create datasets similar to the Common Voice's. Improvements to their algorithms must also be made so that they can make due with less amounts of data. Current ASR systems with low error rates take 
                                            about the equivalent number of words to train as are in billions of webpages. This is not practical if datasets from underrepresented populations are more sparse and less available.

                                        </p>

                                            Like Miriam Vogel, president and CEO of Equal AI, said “I have yet to meet the person who is designing to intentionally discriminate. But sometimes it’s 
                                            hard to admit that you’ve designed something that might have gaps and flaws in.” Companies producing ASR systems must recognize their mistakes and 
                                            commit to make changes in their development processes to create more inclusive technology. The type of data involved in training these systems should
