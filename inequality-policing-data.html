                            <p>
                                After a video went viral of police using excessive force that caused the death of George Floyd in May 2020,
                                the issue of police brutality was brought to the forefront of American life as protests
                                emerged nationwide for months afterwards. Racially-biased policing in the US, however,
                                has been problematic since the inception of our police force.
                            </br>
                                Our anaylsis of data from some of the largest police departments in the U.S. depicts the racial disparity
                                that exists today. We have made use of a comprehensive dataset and<a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/nclr/article-abstract/20/2/181/68886"> litigal work</a> centered
                                around the issue of police brutality. We hope to present an objective, factual visualization of
                                marginalized groups' unjust pattern of treatment by the police in the U.S.

                            <h4>To what extent are marginilized communities disproportionally targeted by police?</h4>
                                <p>
                                    In order to first understand the extent to which marginilized communities are
                                    disproportionally targeted, a dataset containing fatal interactions with police
                                    was evaluated. Causes of death from this dataset capture all aspects of interactions
                                    with police, not only those where a police officer directly killed a person. For example,
                                    the dataset includes cases with a vehicular cause of death, as would occur in a
                                    fatal police car pursuit. Given the racial bias that is evident in traffic stops,
                                    this dataset provides an all-encompassing view of police interactions, not only
                                    those where police were the direct cause.
                                    <br>
                                    By breaking down these fatal interactions proportionally by race, it can be seen
                                    European-American/ White people account for a little less than half of the total
                                    cases (roughly 47%). However, by accounting for racial breakdown within the United
                                    States we can visualize how minorities communities are disproportionally affected.
                                    The racial divide for the United States is as follows: White alone (76.3%), Hispanic or
                                    Latino alone (18.5%), Black or African American alone (13.4%), Asian/Pacific Islander (6.1%),
                                    and Native American/ Alaskan (1.3%).
                                    <br>
                                    After adjusting the number of fatal interactions based on the US racial divide, it is clear
                                    to see the racial-bias against minority communities, as they form an extremely
                                    disproportionate number of cases.

                                <h4>Background</h4>
                                The "stop-and-frisk", or the "Terry stop", is a highly disputed policing practice. The latter name comes from a landmark
                                case, Terry v. Ohio (1968), in which the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the compatibility of this tactic with the Fourth Amendment's
                                ban on "unreasonable searches and seizures." The Court upheld this tactic's constitutionality, so long as it was supported by
                                "specific and articulable facts" that justified criminality and danger.  While "articulable facts" should diminish racially biased
                                stops, racial prejudice in this practice is still observed in data from police departments nationwide.
                                <br>
                                Today, all police agencies are required to record their stops. The collection of stop-and-frisk data is not
                                standardized nationally, however, as a survey showed that 23 out of 44 major PDs don't require specific data collection. The limitations in this kind
                                of data from police departments is daunting and poses challenges since the collection is not uniform. For example, Los Angeles and Oakland
                                PD do not consistently record the race of the suspect. Even in NYC, who is considered the national leader in this kind of data collection,
                                a federal monitor’s report to the court found
                                that in 25% of stops in 2015, officers failed to properly document the suspicion that prompted the stop. <br>

                                In Floyd v. City of New York (2013), Judge Scheindlin relied on data from benchmark studies to determine whether blacks and Hispanics were stopped
                                disproportionately in relation to racial composition, crime rates and various other factors. It was even found the NYPD carried out more stops in areas
                                with predominantly black and Hispanic populations. Along with evidence from the NYPD that officers were acting with discriminatory intent,
                                Judge Scheindlin's findings led her to rule that the NYPD's practices were violating the 14th Amendment and ordered a series of reforms to their policing practices.
                                <br>
                                The monthly calendar to the right depicts data from NYPD on their stop-and-frisk practices. The number of people stopped that were tagged as BLACK
                                consistently contributes 50-60% of the month's stops. Compare this to how approximately <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/newyorkcitynewyork"> 25% </a>
                                of NYC's population is Black / African American.
