                                    <p>By <a href="#">daniela torres</a></p>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>Even now as a junior in college, I still find myself using skills I developed over my four years in the journalism department at my high school. I signed up for the introductory journalism class before I began my freshman year in high school on a whim-- I just needed another elective to complete my schedule and decided against debate or art. After a few assignments, my teacher, advisor and dear friend now, Mrs. E, quickly claimed me as a future newspaper kid.</p>
                            <p>I joined the newspaper class as a sophomore after I completed intro journalism. The beloved newspaper/ yearbook classroom at Clark quickly became a second home. I actually would not be surprised if I spent more waking hours in that classroom than I did in my room at my actual house. Anyway, I owe a lot of both professional skills and creative interests to the newspaper and Mrs. E. Here are just a few:</p>
                            <p>1. Respecting deadlines: As both a writer and an editor of a page, I had to learn how to prioritize and plan my newspaper tasks with other schoolwork. I had to meet draft deadlines when I could and make judgments on which situations required an extension.</p>
                            <p>2. Resiliency: I learned quickly that not all stories or page designs are going to work out as planned. High schoolers are very unreliable-- surprise! And oh, that story is actually way too long to do that kind of dominant graphic. These kinds of situations forced me to problem solve, get creative and not grow too attached to a plan.</p>
                            <p>3. Graphic design: This was one of the most fun parts of being in newspaper for me. Getting inspiration from professional newspapers, magazines and ads, and then making them my own was extremely satisfying. And now, I extend the skill to my side-projects. (See the logo I made in Dec. 2019 for my DJ duo and my <u onclick="window.location.href='resume.html';">graphic resume.</u> </p>
                            <img id ="images" src="img/bg-img/add.gif">
                            <p>4. Talking to strangers: I actually think being in newspaper made me a lot more outgoing of a person. I grew confident in how I navigated social scenes because nothing can really be more awkward than asking questions to a total stranger.</p>
                            <p>5. Leadership: I was the co-editor in chief as a senior with two other talented girls. I learned how to negotiate, brainstorm and lay down the hammer and pick up the slack when we needed to. I also observed different styles of leadership when I was an underclassman and used this as a learning experience when it would be my turn to be chief.</p>
                            <p>6. Self-proficiency: Mrs. E was (is) an extremely busy person and couldn‚Äôt troubleshoot all my problems or give me a personal tutorial when I wasn‚Äôt sure how to recreate a certain design. I had to experiment on my own and resort to Google for tutorials and technical help. In newspaper, I realized that as we get older, we can‚Äôt expect to be spoonfed by the adult in the room. We have to learn how to learn independently. Try and try again until you solve it, and if all else fails, then you ask for help.</p>
                            <p>Although it‚Äôs been years since high school, I still consider my experience in newspaper as the base for a lot of my strengths inside and outside of classroom settings. And, while I‚Äôm not going into the field of journalism, I will never regret all those hours I spent with Mrs. E in her classroom. Will I ever need to know what a pica is, or how to write a bridge in a newspaper story? Probably not. But, if the stars align for me, perhaps my current career path will end up crossing back over someday with this field. Whether or not this happens, I‚Äôll always pat my 14-year-old-self on the back for choosing intro journalism.</p>
